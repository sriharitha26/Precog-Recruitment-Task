# Analyzing Hateful Memes
Submission for Precog Recruitment Task 2 - Analyzing Hateful Memes
This repository contains all the necessary codes, documentations and datasets required for the submission.

## Summary
Memes are quite popular in social media these days and have proved to be attracting people's attention in many ways.
This task focuses on quantitative and qualitative analysis of hateful memes through various computer vision and natural language processing techniques. The analysis gave a very interesting insight into patterns, context and visual queue all of which affect the way we perceive memes. 
The project involves four main tasks which were performed in Google Colab.

## Project Structure
**SubTask - 1. Object Detection**
The datasets used for this task and all the executable codes with outputs are given in this [link](./ObjectDetectionTask) .

**SubTask - 2. Caption Impact Assessment**
The datasets and all the executable codes related to this task are given in this [link](./CaptionImpactAssessment) .

**SubTask -3. Classification System Development**
This task was approached with a view of segregating/classifying the dataset given into meme or not. All the required dataset and codes are available [here](./ClassificationSystemDevelopment) .

**BonusTask - Toxicity Prediction**
Predciting whether a meme is toxic or not. The following [link](./BonusTask) gives access to view all the dataset and codes used to tackle this approach.
